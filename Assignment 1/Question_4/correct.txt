My holiday. We went to my auntâ€™s farm. She has ponies. She taught me
to ride the ponies, and that was great fun. And she has lots and lots
of strawberries. We could pick them ourselves, and we could eat as
many as we wanted. My uncle let me help him to milk the cows. It is
very difficult. The duck in the duck pond bit my finger when I gave
him bread to eat.
